 # LG Input Hook
 Allows for remapping remote buttons on LG WebOS TVs.
 
 The [homebrew channel](https://github.com/webosbrew/webos-homebrew-channel/) with root access is required.
 
 ## How to use
 The app needs to be launched at least once for it to begin working. Afterwards it will persist even across reboots.
 
 To remap a button, press `Add keybind` in the interface.
 
 Set the ID to the ID of the button you want to remap
 
 Next, choose what you want to do with this button. To disable the button, choose `Disable`. To make the button execute a command, choose `Execute`, and enter the command. To replace the button with another button, choose `Replace`, and fill in the ID of the button you want to replace it with.
 
 When you are done, press `Save changes`. The changes should be automatically applied.
 
 To find the ID of a button, view the log files in the interface, press a button, and see what pops up. You should see something like `id => 1`. The first number is the ID of the button.
 
 The log files you should view, depend on your WebOS version and what remote you are using. Each log is described in the dropdown menu.
 
 Alternatively, I have collected the button IDs for every button on [this IR remote](https://www.lg.com/us/tv-audio-video-accessories/lg-AGF76631064-tv-remote-contol), which you can find listed [here](https://gist.github.com/Simon34545/31c528bfe8540880936fc4c580723a02).
