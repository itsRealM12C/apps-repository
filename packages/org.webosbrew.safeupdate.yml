  This application is a tool helpful in recovering broken or potentially-broken
  Homebrew Channel installations. It elevates its own root code execution service,
  and allows for Homebrew Channel update/reelevation.

  This is necessary when updating webOS 22 TVs from Homebrew Channel versions
  older than 0.6.3 (due to a bug in self-update feature on these versions)

  In most other situations - it is a potentially useful tool one could use to
  avoid having to go through the hassle of setting up and rooting their TV all over
  again.

  Usage
  -----

  0. Install application via Homebrew Channel
  1. Launch application
  2. Wait for its service to get elevated - loading indicator at the bottom of the
     screen should disappear after a couple of seconds. Note that initial startup
     requires correctly set up rooted Homebrew Channel, ie. "Root status" needs
     to be "ok".
  3. Application is ready:
      * **Press 1 to update Homebrew Channel to latest published release.**
      * Press 2 to reelevate Homebrew Channel service (ie. when Homebrew Channel
        Settings "Root status" indicates "unelevated", even though your TV
        *should* be rooted)
      * Press 8 to launch emergency **passwordless** root telnet server on port 22.
      * Press 9 to launch /var/lib/webosbrew/startup.sh (startup hooks) - this is
        carried out automatically by Homebrew Channel on startup if its service is
        correctly elevated. (note: this **may** result in an error if your TV has
        already executed startup scripts)
  4. If any operation selected above succeeded, you should get a "Finished."
     message in log listing.
