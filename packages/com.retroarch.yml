  RetroArch is the reference frontend for the libretro API.
  Popular examples of implementations for this API includes video game system emulators and game engines as well as
  more generalized 3D programs.
  These programs are instantiated as dynamic libraries. We refer to these as "libretro cores".

  ## libretro
  
  [libretro](https://www.libretro.com) is an API that exposes generic audio/video/input callbacks.
  A frontend for libretro (such as RetroArch) handles video output, audio output, input and application lifecycle.
  A libretro core written in portable C or C++ can run seamlessly on many platforms with very little to no porting effort.
  
  While RetroArch is the reference frontend for libretro, several other projects have used the libretro
  interface to include support for emulators and/or game engines. libretro is completely open and free for anyone to use.
