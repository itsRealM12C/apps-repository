  ## ⚠️ Note for rooted webOS 22 users
  Use Homebrew Channel Updater app when updating from Homebrew Channel version
  older than v0.6.3! Due to a bug in older versions, updating here *may* cause
  loss of root access/permissions.

  Features
  --------

  * Independent webOS package repository
      * Homebrew discovery, installation & updates

  * (root) Root execution service that can be easily used by webOS homebrew
    developers without a need of separate privilege escalation handling (`luna://org.webosbrew.hbchannel.service/exec`)
  * (root) Disable some telemetry
  * (root) Startup user hooks (executable scripts present in `/var/lib/webosbrew/init.d` are run on bootup)
  * (root) Remote access
      * SSH - public key authenticated (with default `alpine` password until
        authorized keys are provisioned)
      * Telnet - unauthenticated, use sparingly
  * (root) Failsafe mode
      * In case a device crashes on boot only an emergency shell will be exposed
        via telnet. In order to disable it fix the original crash cause and remove
        `/var/luna/preferences/webosbrew_failsafe` flag file.
